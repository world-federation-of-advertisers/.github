Halo CMM incorporates an innovative set of technologies that empower local markets to use data assets like panels and exposure events to create measurement reports that are available via a set of Halo APIs. The resulting measurement is intended to meet the needs of the most ambitious advertiser use cases and the demands of media owners for content measurement.

The **core technology** can be found [here](https://github.com/world-federation-of-advertisers/cross-media-measurement).

If you are interested in **contributing to the project**, see [here](https://github.com/world-federation-of-advertisers/cross-media-measurement/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.
